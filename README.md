- 👋 Hi, I’m I am a linguist and a student at the Master's Programme in Language Science with a Specialisation in Bilingualism at Stockholm University. 
- My expected graduation date is Summer-Autumn 2022. 

- 👀 I’m interested in sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, computational sociolinguistics, and bilingual education. 
- I am particularly interested in policing language in bilingual schools, bilingual children with ASD, translanguaging in bilingual classrooms,  and L2 English accent bias. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, improving my Python skills and working on my MA thesis in multimodal translanguaging in bilingual non-verbal children with autism.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on collecting data about bilingual non-verbal children with ASD and their MCDIs.
